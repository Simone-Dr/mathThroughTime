	        		<p> We start our journey through time and space around 3500 BC with the civilisation of the Sumer and later on the Babylonians, who developed an innovation to numeral systems. They introduced the positional notation. The value of every digit is determined by the symbol, as well as its position within the number. In our modern decimal system, also called Hindu–Arabic numeral system, the position of the digit determines whether it is multiplied by 1, 10, 100... The Babylonians used base 60 and made calculations more efficient, because huge numbers can be displayed with less digits. The first known positional numeral system still influences us today: there are 60 minutes in an hour and 360 degrees in a circle. </p>
