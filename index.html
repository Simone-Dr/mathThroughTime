	        		They introduced the positional notation. The value of every digit is determined by the symbol, as well as its position within the number. In our modern decimal system, also called Hindu–Arabic numeral system, the position of the digit determines whether it is multiplied by 1, 10, 100... The Babylonians used base 60 and made calculations more efficient, because huge numbers can be displayed with less digits. The power of the notational system allowed the development of geometric, arithmetic and algebraic methods that made very accurate calculations like

The problems (among other things) include fractional expressions, linear equations and the calculation of volumes and areas and stem from practical problems of trade and the market. The papyrus gives us insights on the mathematical methods of the time, one of them being a way of multiplication which requires only the ability to multiply by two and to add. It decomposes the smaller multiplicand into powers of two while creating a table of doublings of the second multiplicand.</p>

	        		was an ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician and founder of an influential religious-philosophical movement called Pythagoreanism. Though his work was not always based solely on his own ideas, the way he and his followers developed it by using axioms and logic to build a mathematical system was out of the ordinary and a significant legacy for his successors. While having made substantial contributions in other areas like astronomy and music,  Pythagoras is most well-known for his mathematical discoveries particularly the Pythagorean theorem. It states that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>). There are several geometric and algebraic proofs of the theorem, interactively displayed is the Pythagorean proof, which is a proof by rearrangement. There is evidence that the Babylonians, Chinese and Egyptians knew of the mathematical relationship among the sides of a right triangle. The Babylonian tablet

	        		<p> Hippasus of Metapontum (circa 530 – circa 450 BC) was a Pythagorean philosopher, who is sometimes credited with the discovery of irrational numbers. According to legend, the other Pythagoreans preached that all numbers could be expressed as a ratio of integers ( --> rational numbers) and drowned Hippasus for his proof of irrational numbers.
					Hippasos knew of the Pythagorean theorem from which resulted that a triangle with the length 1 for both short sides has a hypotenuse of length √2. 					
	        		<span class= "hoverSpan">He proved that √2 could not be expressed as a ratio of two integers <img class= "hoverImg" src="graphics/generalImages/proofIrrat.png" /> <span class ="hoverText">This proof by contradiction appeared first as a full proof in Euclid's Elements, it is likely that Hippasus used a geometric proof.</span>

					and therefore proved the existence of irrational numbers, which have an infinite amount of decimal places without terminating, nor ending with a repeating sequence. 
					However, the evidence linking the discovery of irrational numbers to Hippasus and his death as a result of it, is confused. </br>
					On the right you can see the spiral of Theodorus, which is a spiral composed of right triangles, placed edge-to-edge. Theodorus of Cyrene, who was an ancient Greek who lived during the 5th century BC, proved the irrationality of all square roots of the non-square numbers up to 17.

	        		was a Greek mathematician who is often referred to as the “founder of geometry”. He wrote the “Elements” which can be considered the most influential mathematical work of all time. The “Elements” is a collection of 13 books that cover various topics like plane and solid Euclidean geometry and number theory. Euclid's “Elements” contain numerous important mathematical results like the Pythagorean theorem, binomial formulas, the Thales's theorem, the intercept theorem and the golden ratio. Much of the material is not original to Euclid, he rather built on the foundations of many influential mathematicians, but his work introduced new axiomatized, logical structures. His first book begins with 23 definitions for terms like line point, line, surface et cetera. He then makes five postulates followed by five common notions and 48 propositions, the first of which is displayed on the right.

The unmarked numbers are potential prime numbers. The smallest unmarked number is always prime, all multiples of that prime are marked as composite (not prime). The next larger integer is determined, which since it is not a multiple of numbers smaller than itself, is prime. All multiples are marked again.
